**Exciting News: Lithuania's Public Sector develops an Unified Metadata Model**

We are thrilled to announce a significant advancement for the Lithuanian public sector: the implementation of a comprehensive metadata model. This development marks a major milestone in the enhancement of data management and govtech services across the nation. The first release of this model will be built on three main pillars:
1.	DCAT-AP-LT with Annex of HVD: This adaptation of the DCAT-AP standard, tailored specifically for Lithuania, includes an annex of High Value Datasets (HVD). It ensures a structured and standardized approach to cataloging and sharing public sector data.
2.	Specification of Data Mapping: Known as the Specification of Data Structure, this element focuses on mapping the physical, logical, and semantic layers of data. It provides a clear framework for organizing and understanding data across various dimensions.
3.	UAPI Specification: This Universal API specification will be applied to all public information systems for data services. It facilitates seamless integration and interoperability between different systems, promoting efficient data exchange and accessibility.
The implementation of these unified specifications is set to revolutionize govtech services in Lithuania. By adopting a common approach, the public sector will be able to save valuable resources, streamline processes, and enhance service delivery. This initiative paves the way for innovative solutions, improved data management, and better public services.
We look forward to seeing the positive impact of this initiative on Lithuania's public sector and the broader community. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to advance our data capabilities and drive digital transformation in the public domain.
